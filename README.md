## About <a name = "about"></a>
The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu was completed during the Kamakura period. Fujiwara no Teika compiled them by taking one poem each from hundred of the best poets in chronological order from Emperor Tenji to the Retired Emperor Juntoku to decorate the sliding doors at the Ogura mountain villa, the summer home of the general and poet Utsunomiya Yoritsuna.
